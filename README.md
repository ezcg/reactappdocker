# Getting Started with React App Docker

In the reactappdocker directory, run on the command line:

``docker-compose up``

This will spin up a docker container with a react app inside. Access it in your browser by going to:

``http://localhost:3000``

To bring the app down, run on the command line:

``docker-compose down``

Enter the docker container from your host machine by typing on the command line (might be different for Windows or Mac):

``docker exec -it reactappdocker bash``
